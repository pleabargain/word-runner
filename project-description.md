- **Collection:** Collect words corresponding to the current time frame.
- **Categories:** Verbs, Nouns, Adjectives, Days of the Week, Months.
- **Time Frames:**
    - **Past:** Color-coded (e.g., Sepia). Words in past tense?
    - **Present:** Color-coded (e.g., Green/Normal).
    - **Future:** Color-coded (e.g., Neon/Blue).
- **Setting:** Infinite cityscape with distinct blocks.
- **Collection:** Collision-based. The character physically runs into words floating in their lane.
