# Agent Rules

This file defines the operating rules for the agent in this workspace.

1. **Clarification Protocol**
   - Ask a multiple choice question when seeking clarification from the user.

2. **Timestamping**
   - Date stamp using ISO time stamp (e.g., 2025-12-02T13:53:34+04:00).

3. **Task Management**
   - Create a task list of things that need to be done.

4. **Preservation Protocol**
   - Do not delete or destroy functionality without asking the user first.

5. **Documentation**
   - Maintain a `README.md` file that describes the project and includes a datestamp.
