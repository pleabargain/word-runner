**Date:** 2025-12-02T13:55:12+04:00

## Overview
"Word Runner" is a web-based infinite scroller game set in a rectilinear, New York-style cityscape. The player navigates an infinite city environment while interacting with words.

## Goals
- [ ] Create an infinite scrolling cityscape environment with buildings. The building must have clearly stated names e.g. Train Station, Doctor's Office, grocery store, etc

- [ ] Implement a character navigation system for rectilinear streets.
- [ ] Implement a scoring system based on collecting an equal balance of word types.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Objective:** Navigate through city blocks representing different time frames (Past, Present, Future).
- **Collection:** Collect words corresponding to the current time frame.
- **Categories:** Verbs, Nouns, Adjectives, Days of the Week, Months.
- **Time Frames:**
    - **PAST:** Color-coded (e.g., Sepia). Words in past tense?
    - **PRESENT:** Color-coded (e.g., Green/Normal).
    - **FUTURE:** Color-coded (e.g., Neon/Blue).
- **Setting:** Infinite cityscape with distinct blocks.
- **Collection:** Collision-based. The character physically runs into words floating in their lane.

## Technology Stack
- HTML5 / CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla or Framework TBD)
